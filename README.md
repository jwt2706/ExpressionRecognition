# Facial Expression Recognition

This will recognize your facial expression (hopefully correctly), and maybe play some epic meme sounds.<br />
I'm not sure why I made this but I had this idea a while ago, and the old version I had did not work at all lmao. So recently I decided to have a second shot at this.
The current version uses the [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index) library, with [this model](https://huggingface.co/Xenova/facial_emotions_image_detection).
